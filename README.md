# presentation_projhandler
A presentation based on Google HTML5 Rocks and materialize css
The presentation is fully based on the [template] (https://github.com/slideshow-templates/slideshow-google-html5-slides.git/) and adds [materialize](materializecss.com) for certain purposes.
You may want to visit [slideshow](https://slideshow-s9.github.io/) with which it was created.
For textile files, I used [RedCloth](redcloth.org)
NOTE: I had to edit the HTML file to include the tables and some slides, though.
